# Selector Echidna

Test out css / html selectors live, to see what you'd pull with your { webscraper / parser / js function }

# Installation

 - Go to ```chrome://extensions``` in your browser
 - Enable developer mode, in case you haven't already
 - Hit ```LOAD UNPACKED``` and select the extension directory
 
# Usage

Hit the popup and just start typing.  Any elements that would be grabbed with your selector will be highlit in red.  Currently does not support multiple selectors.

The popup should also display a comprehensive listing of all classes and tags used on the page, as well as a count of each, sorted descending. 


# Issues

Some pages may break almost completely as soon as you type.  It has to do with the style clearing function, and it's rare enough / enough of a pain to fix that I have so far deemed it unnecessary to do so.
