# Selector Echidna

This is a little chrome plugin that allows flexible querying of selectors on a website to rapidly test whether they select the things you want them to, and only those.

# Usage

Put your selector in the text field.  Elements will be highlit with a red border.

# TODO

[ ] multiple selector behavior / recombinant selector behavior
[ ] error handling
[ ] echidna breaks zulip.  I think this has to do with the style clearing behavior.
